# Disection of the Apple Internet Recovery protocol and Security Analysis

NOTE: The authors machine always downgrades from 10.15.3 to 10.13.0 via
internet recovery, therefore some experiments may not be working the same
due to a network issue with an attacker at a position of privilege on the
network.

## Verification of BaseSystem.dmg and OSDInstall.dmg

See `doc/chunklist_v1.md`


## Request / Response of Internet Recovery image location

PAW and ruby code

`doc/Apple Internet Recovery.paw`
`lib/request_recovery.rb`

It seems that it is impossible to fake a response from the Apple Internet
recovery server, but since the forgery token is not mixed in with the signed
response it opens up the case where a man-in-the-middle attack on the request
may occur.  This leads to the potential to downgrade an operating system.


This may be in part due to the age of the IR protocol and lack of stronger
PKI based crypto in older (read Lion 10.9) versions of IR.


### Request Format

Requests are made to `http://osrecovery.apple.com/InstallationPayload/RecoveryImage`

A request is in the form of:

    cid=A64F96125D28533D
    sn=C079442000SJRWLAX
    bid=Mac-7BA5B2DFE22DDD8C
    k=CF4EF754A68299485E52179B73382421FDBE38BAA06C7CE518A9A4BA91E3C96D
    os=latest
    bv=17.16.11081.0.0,0
    fg=9ECA302EC3E25279AA80C088EF82A821DAD22197B8516F2E9966CC462B524393

An analysis of variables comes to these assumed names

* cid - ChipID
* SN - Motherboard Serial number
* bid - Board ID
* k - Key or some form of challenge
* os - The requested OS
* bv - Board version
* fg - Anti forgery challenge


### Response Format

A response is in the form of

An analysis shows the following values

* AP - Apple's update ID for the packge
* AU - base system URL to download from
* AH - Some form of hash for the base system URL / content
* AT - BaseSystem url token cookie
* CU - chunklist URL (this becomes dangerous if downgrade attacked to v1)
* CH - Chunklist url hash / content
* CT - Chunklist url token cookie
